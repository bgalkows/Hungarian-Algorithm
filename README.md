# Hungarian Algorithm

Here I have posted my implementation of the Hungarian algorithm, a powerful
solution to the linear sum assignment problem.  The goal is to find the optimal
pairing of rows to columns in a matrix in order to minimize the sum cost.

I needed the algorithm for a larger project involving convolutional neural
networks, the bulk of which cannot be shared due to an NDA.
